      <h2>Who She Is:</h2>
      <p>The Blessed Virgin Mary is the mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ. She was closest to Our Lord when He was on earth. She nurtured Him from when she gave birth to Him till when He was 30 years when He started his public ministry. She shared in his joys, sorrows and glory.</p>
      <p>In the Catholic Church, distinctive Marian dogmas are held about Our Lady, namely her Divine Maternity (her status as the Mother of God), her Immaculate Conception (she was conceived without Original sin), her perpetual virginity (she remained a virgin all her life), and her Assumption into heaven. (God took her up body and soul at the end of her life)</p>

      <h2>Why I Love Her:</h2>
      <p>There is really much to say about the Blessed Virgin Mary, which is beyond the scope of an article. Much has been written on her by various Saints and Fathers of the Church. The different Marian Devotions not only honor Her but also lead us closer to God. She's God's handwork and like artists are praised by praises to their works of art, so do we worship God in respecting His handmaid, the Blessed Virgin.</p>
      <p>Our Lady represents many signs (figurative ones) in the old testament accompanying the coming of Our Lord, such as: The Burning Bush, The Ark of the Covenant, The Rainbow given to Noah, Gideon's Fleece, The Blossoming Rod, Samson's Sweet Honeycomb, Tower of David, Solomon's Throne, The Eastern Gate to name a few. To really know who the Blessed Virgin Truly is, read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystical_City_of_God" title="Mystical City of God" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mystical City of God</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Jesus_of_%C3%81greda" title="Venerable Mary of Agreda" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venerable Mary of Agreda</a></p>
      <p>I love our lady because of the many virtues she had. Not much is said of her in the Bible but great are the things revelations and tradition say about her. I love her because she is a good mother and she really helps. Hope you will get to love her too.</p>
